# 64-Bit-Full-Adder
took 4 16 bit adders and combined them to make a 64 bit full adder
So we had a 1 bit adder. That overflowed pretty quickly. Then we had a 4 bit adder,
 which overflowed too. Then we had a 16 bit adder, but ultimately, it too overflowed. So,
 ladies and gentlemen, I took 4 16 bit adders and combined them to make a 64 bit full adder !
